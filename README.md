### Hello World, Iâ€™m Ned ðŸ‘‹


- I am currently a senior quantitative risk analyst working on (credit risk) model monitoring and performance
- Meanwhile, I am still doing (i.e., finishing) my PhD in marketing analytics at [Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/en/persons/c/choungprayoon-tanetpong/) in Sweden
- In my GitHub, you'll discover an extensive walkthrough of the code developed for my PhD project, a comprehensive overview of my relevant work experience prior to pursuing my PhD, and a collection of various coding projects and initiatives I have undertaken and developed.
- Any ideas or collaborations in finance (e.g., credit risk) and marketing (e.g., marketing mix/price promotion) are welcome!
- You can find more about me and my (research) work on [my personal website](https://tanetpong-c.com/)
